    "As a Python only developer, I found it extremly hard to learn a new langauge particular with language like C++ or Rust that involves build steps. (Does it has debugger support like PyCharm?). I tried to learn Rust by reading the book last year, I finished a few chapters but never get to write any programme and I forgot most of it already. The only thing that stays is [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) has a concept of lifetime and borrow checker.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am hoping that by pushing my [learning journey](https://github.com/noklam/learning_rust) online will give myself extra motivation. Ultimately I want to learn just enough Rust to optimise performance for Python program, it could be just simple algorithm, or if I ever learn enough I would like to write an event simulation engine (or at least learn to build one).\n",

I prefer to stick with a good enough choice (noted that building and distributing Python package is a headache, I don't want to spend my energy on this now)\n",
